## Introduction
The Archive is a Pinterest-like web app where fashion enthusiasts can upload, discuss and review different pieces of clothing. The front end is made using HTML/CSS with the help of the EJS templating language. The back end is a simple REST API with NodeJS and Express- combined with MongoDB for the database. This project was created to help me learn and better understand server-side rendering.
